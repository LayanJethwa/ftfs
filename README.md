# FTF (First To Find) map
A data visualisation project, showing the time taken for an FTF in geocaches around my area using Leaflet mapping with the Folium Python module.
The map is in the index.html file, open in Chrome browser to view, and at pages.
You can see a screenshot of the map at image.png.
